### üîÑ Currently Working On
- None; implementation is staged for verification next session

### üîú Next Actions
1. Merge codex state-sync + mention scheduling back into `ConversationGraph` and retest pause/inject
2. Restore adapter meta/role data and configurable API base URL in frontend hooks before UI polish
3. Decide on `/conversation/stop` endpoint vs. removing Stop button to avoid partial shutdown UX

### üöß Blockers
- None; StrictMode dev run succeeded locally, but codex backport work is queued

### üß∞ Environment Setup Needs
- Backend: `cd backend && source .venv/bin/activate && python main.py`
- Frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
- **Functional:** `Stop` button only closes SSE client; backend conversation continues running until natural end
- **Critical (Regression risk):** React StrictMode duplication appears resolved after live test, continue monitoring during codex merge
- **Minor**: Python 3.13 shows occasional escape sequence warnings (cosmetic only)
- **Performance**: Long conversations (50+ turns) may need pagination or optimization

### üí° Recent Decisions & Ideas

**SSE Architecture Fix (Sept 27, 2025):**
- **Live verification:** End-to-end Playwright run confirmed start/pause/resume/stop flow and human message injection against local backend
- **Hook Separation:** Adopt Codex branch pattern (`useSSEStream` for connection + `useAISDKAdapter` for event processing) to avoid duplicate handlers under StrictMode
- **Status Propagation:** Centralize conversation status updates in the adapter to keep UI logic thin and deterministic

**Master vs Codex Branch Audit (Sept 27, 2025):**
- Discovered `master` dropped key `ConversationGraph` state syncing that `codex` still has; need to reapply to keep pause/inject stable
- Expanded `MERGE.md` with prioritized backend scheduling, frontend hook, and UI alignment guidance to steer the eventual merge
- Completed first wave of backports: restored mention-aware scheduling, adapter metadata, and avatars while removing the dormant Stop UI until a backend endpoint exists

**Day 2 Architecture Enhancements:**
- **Advanced State Management:** Thread-safe conversation state with real-time pause/resume controls
- **Enhanced Error Recovery:** Graceful AI failure handling with conversation continuation instead of crashes
- **Timeout Protection:** 5-minute pause timeout to prevent resource leaks and infinite waiting
- **Model Strategy:** Latest AI models (gpt-4.1-mini, claude-sonnet-4-20250514, gemini-2.5-flash) for improved performance
- **API Design:** RESTful conversation control endpoints with proper HTTP status codes
- **Event Broadcasting:** Comprehensive SSE event system with structured data for frontend consumption

**Previous Foundations:**
- **AGENTS.md Pattern:** Created standardized instructions for AI tools to maintain project state
- **LangGraph Architecture:** Multi-agent orchestration with conditional routing and pause nodes
- **AI Participant Strategy:** 3 distinct personalities with proper name referencing and context awareness
- **ADR System:** Major technical decisions documented in docs/adr/ with structured format
- **AI-Native Workflow:** Self-maintaining documentation system for seamless AI collaboration
