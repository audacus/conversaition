# Conversaition - Development Progress

**Date:** September 25, 2025
**Session:** MVP Day 1 - Multi-Agent LangGraph Foundation
**Status:** üöÄ **STARTING IMPLEMENTATION**

## üéØ Current Status

**Project Setup Complete** - Comprehensive AI-native documentation structure established. Basic SSE streaming proof-of-concept validated. Ready to begin MVP Day 1 implementation.

**Next Focus:** Day 1 - Multi-Agent LangGraph Foundation

### ‚úÖ Recently Completed
- Phase 0: Proof of Concept validation (September 22, 2025)
- MVP scope and architecture definition (September 25, 2025)
- AGENT.md creation for AI tool instructions (September 25, 2025)
- Information architecture setup (README.md, MVP.md, PROGRESS.md, AGENT.md)
- Enhanced project structure with .env.example, docs/adr/ (September 25, 2025)
- Created comprehensive Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Consolidated PATTERNS.md content into ADRs and AGENT.md
- Established AI-native project maintenance workflow
- Committed all changes to git with proper structure
- Validated basic SSE streaming between frontend/backend

### üîÑ Currently Working On
- Session complete - ready for handoff to next implementation session

### üìã Next Steps
1. Add LangGraph dependencies to backend (langchain, langgraph, provider packages)
2. Create participants.py with 3 AI configurations (Alice/OpenAI, Bob/Anthropic, Charlie/Gemini)
3. Build conversation_graph.py with LangGraph multi-agent orchestration
4. Extend adapter.py for LangGraph ‚Üí AI SDK event conversion
5. Update main.py SSE endpoint to use LangGraph instead of mock data
6. Test: 3 AIs debate "Should AI have creative rights?" for 5+ exchanges

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Blockers/Issues
- None currently - ready to proceed with implementation

### üí° Recent Decisions & Ideas
- **AGENT.md Pattern:** Created standardized instructions for AI tools to maintain project state
- **Information Architecture:** Separated concerns - README (vision), MVP (scope), PROGRESS (current status), AGENT (instructions)
- **AI Participant Strategy:** 3 distinct personalities - Alice (analytical), Bob (creative), Charlie (contrarian)
- **Technology Choices:** LangGraph for orchestration, existing SSE foundation, custom adapter for AI SDK compatibility
- **ADR System:** Major technical decisions now documented in docs/adr/ with structured format
- **Documentation Consolidation:** Eliminated PATTERNS.md redundancy, moved content to ADRs and AGENT.md
- **Environment Setup:** Templated .env.example with comprehensive API key setup
- **AI-Native Workflow:** Self-maintaining documentation system for seamless AI collaboration
- **Git Structure:** Clean commits with proper separation of concerns

## üîß Quick Start Commands

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
cd /Users/dbu/workspace/conversaition/backend
source .venv/bin/activate
# Set environment variables (when implementing Day 1):
# export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
# export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
# export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-key"
python main.py
```
*Backend available at: http://localhost:8000*

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
cd /Users/dbu/workspace/conversaition/frontend
npm run dev
```
*Frontend available at: http://localhost:3000*

### Current Test Status
- ‚úÖ Basic SSE streaming works (mock data)
- ‚úÖ Frontend consumes SSE correctly
- ‚è≥ Ready to implement LangGraph multi-agent system

### Current Implementation Status (Day 1 MVP Tasks)

**Day 2: Enhanced Conversation Control** (Pending Day 1)
- [ ] Add conversation state management
- [ ] Implement pause/resume functionality
- [ ] Enable human message injection API
- [ ] Improve turn management logic
- [ ] Update frontend with participant identification
- [ ] Test: User-moderated debate

**Day 3: Polish & Validation** (Pending Day 1-2)
- [ ] Error handling and connection recovery
- [ ] Basic conversation persistence
- [ ] UI improvements for multi-participant display

## üìÅ File Changes This Session
- Enhanced `AGENT.md` - Added coding standards, file organization, security practices
- Created `.env.example` - Complete environment variable templates for API keys
- Created `docs/adr/001-langgraph-ai-sdk-adapter.md` - Core architectural decision with SSE/AI SDK patterns
- Created `docs/adr/002-langgraph-multi-agent-patterns.md` - Multi-agent conversation patterns
- **Eliminated `PATTERNS.md`** - Consolidated content into ADRs and AGENT.md to reduce redundancy
- Updated `PROGRESS.md` - Session completion status and handoff information
- Committed changes: `940483a` (documentation structure) and `f49035b` (.gitignore fix)
- Validated basic SSE streaming functionality between frontend/backend

**Next Session:** Begin Day 1 MVP implementation

**Ready to Start:** All documentation and basic validation complete. Next AI agent can immediately begin:
1. Add LangGraph dependencies to backend (`pip install langchain langgraph langchain-openai langchain-anthropic langchain-google-genai`)
2. Create API key environment variables using `.env.example` template
3. Create `participants.py` with 3 AI configurations (Alice/OpenAI, Bob/Anthropic, Charlie/Gemini)
4. Build `conversation_graph.py` with LangGraph multi-agent orchestration
5. Extend `adapter.py` for LangGraph ‚Üí AI SDK event conversion
6. Update `main.py` SSE endpoint to use LangGraph instead of mock data
7. Test: 3 AIs debate "Should AI have creative rights?" for 5+ exchanges
