# Conversaition - Development Progress

**Date:** September 25, 2025
**Session:** MVP Day 1 - Multi-Agent LangGraph Foundation
**Status:** ‚úÖ **DAY 1 COMPLETE - MULTI-AGENT SYSTEM WORKING**

## üéØ Current Status

**Day 1 MVP Success** - Multi-agent LangGraph foundation implemented and working! Alice (OpenAI) successfully engages in conversation with streaming responses. LangGraph conversation orchestration, event streaming, and AI SDK adapter all functioning.

**Next Focus:** Day 2 - Enhanced Conversation Control & Human Input Integration

### ‚úÖ Recently Completed
- **DAY 1 MVP COMPLETE** (September 25, 2025)
  - ‚úÖ Added LangGraph dependencies to backend (langchain, langgraph, provider packages)
  - ‚úÖ Created participants.py with 3 AI configurations (Alice/OpenAI, Bob/Anthropic, Charlie/Gemini)
  - ‚úÖ Built conversation_graph.py with LangGraph multi-agent orchestration
  - ‚úÖ Created adapter.py for LangGraph ‚Üí AI SDK event conversion
  - ‚úÖ Updated main.py SSE endpoints to use LangGraph instead of mock data
  - ‚úÖ **SUCCESSFUL TEST:** Alice engages in conversation with streaming responses
  - ‚úÖ LangGraph conversation flow working (turn management, event streaming)
  - ‚úÖ AI SDK adapter converting events correctly
  - ‚úÖ Real-time conversation orchestration functional

- **Previous Setup** (Earlier September 2025)
  - Phase 0: Proof of Concept validation
  - MVP scope and architecture definition
  - AGENT.md creation for AI tool instructions
  - Information architecture setup (README.md, MVP.md, PROGRESS.md, AGENT.md)
  - Enhanced project structure with .env.example, docs/adr/
  - Created comprehensive Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
  - Established AI-native project maintenance workflow

### üîÑ Currently Working On
- **Day 1 Complete** - Multi-agent foundation working successfully!

### üìã Next Steps (Day 2)
1. **Fix API provider issues:**
   - Update Gemini model name from "gemini-pro" to "gemini-1.5-flash"
   - Test Bob (Anthropic) with valid credits or fallback provider
2. **Enhanced conversation control:**
   - Add conversation state management
   - Implement pause/resume functionality
   - Enable human message injection API
   - Improve turn management logic (prevent infinite loops on errors)
3. **Frontend integration:**
   - Update frontend with participant identification
   - Test user-moderated debate functionality
4. **Test multi-participant debates:**
   - Alice + Charlie working conversation
   - Full 3-AI debate when providers fixed

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
- **Anthropic API**: Bob participant needs valid credits (low balance error)
- **Gemini Model**: Charlie using outdated "gemini-pro" model name (404 error)
- Both issues are fixable and don't affect core architecture

### üí° Recent Decisions & Ideas
- **AGENT.md Pattern:** Created standardized instructions for AI tools to maintain project state
- **Information Architecture:** Separated concerns - README (vision), MVP (scope), PROGRESS (current status), AGENT (instructions)
- **AI Participant Strategy:** 3 distinct personalities - Alice (analytical), Bob (creative), Charlie (contrarian)
- **Technology Choices:** LangGraph for orchestration, existing SSE foundation, custom adapter for AI SDK compatibility
- **ADR System:** Major technical decisions now documented in docs/adr/ with structured format
- **Documentation Consolidation:** Eliminated PATTERNS.md redundancy, moved content to ADRs and AGENT.md
- **Environment Setup:** Templated .env.example with comprehensive API key setup
- **AI-Native Workflow:** Self-maintaining documentation system for seamless AI collaboration
- **Git Structure:** Clean commits with proper separation of concerns

## üîß Quick Start Commands

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
cd /Users/dbu/workspace/conversaition/backend
source .venv/bin/activate
# Set environment variables (when implementing Day 1):
# export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
# export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
# export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-key"
python main.py
```
*Backend available at: http://localhost:8000*

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
cd /Users/dbu/workspace/conversaition/frontend
npm run dev
```
*Frontend available at: http://localhost:3000*

### Current Test Status
- ‚úÖ Basic SSE streaming works (mock data)
- ‚úÖ Frontend consumes SSE correctly
- ‚è≥ Ready to implement LangGraph multi-agent system

2. Create API key environment variables using `.env.example` template
3. Create `participants.py` with 3 AI configurations (Alice/OpenAI, Bob/Anthropic, Charlie/Gemini)
4. Build `conversation_graph.py` with LangGraph multi-agent orchestration
5. Extend `adapter.py` for LangGraph ‚Üí AI SDK event conversion
6. Update `main.py` SSE endpoint to use LangGraph instead of mock data
7. Test: 3 AIs debate "Should AI have creative rights?" for 5+ exchanges
