  - ‚úÖ **Technical Foundation** - All core architecture components functional

- **Implementation Details:**
  - Created participants.py with 3 AI configurations

  - Created adapter.py for LangGraph ‚Üí AI SDK event conversion
  - Updated main.py with proper .env loading and SSE endpoints
  - Fixed Bob model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022

- **Previous Setup** (Earlier September 2025)
  - Phase 0: Proof of Concept validation
  - MVP scope and architecture definition
  - AGENT.md creation for AI tool instructions
  - Information architecture setup (README.md, MVP.md, PROGRESS.md, AGENT.md)
  - Enhanced project structure with .env.example, docs/adr/
  - Created comprehensive Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
  - Established AI-native project maintenance workflow

### üîÑ Currently Working On
- **Day 1 Complete** - Multi-agent foundation working successfully!

### üìã Next Steps (Day 2)
1. **Update to latest AI models:**
   - Alice: Update from gpt-4 to **gpt-5-mini**
   - Bob: Update from claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 to **claude-3-5-haiku-20241022**
   - Charlie: Update from gemini-pro to **gemini-2.5-flash**
2. **Fix Bob streaming issue:**
   - Error: "Attempted to access streaming response content, without having called read()"
   - LangChain Anthropic streaming implementation needs update
   - API connection working (HTTP 200), just streaming mechanism
3. **Test full 3-AI conversations:**
   - Complete Alice + Bob + Charlie debates with latest models
   - Validate improved conversation quality with newer models
4. **Enhanced conversation control:**
   - Implement pause/resume functionality in LangGraph
   - Enable human message injection during conversations
   - Improve error handling (prevent infinite retry loops)
5. **Frontend integration:**
   - Test frontend consumption of SSE streams
   - Add participant identification UI
   - Implement conversation controls

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
- **Bob Streaming Bug**: `"Attempted to access streaming response content, without having called read()"`
  - Anthropic API connection working (HTTP 200)
  - Credits added and model fixed (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022)
  - Issue: LangChain Anthropic streaming implementation needs fix
- **Charlie Model**: Still using outdated "gemini-pro" (needs update to gemini-1.5-flash)
- **Minor**: Python 3.13 shows escape sequence warning (cosmetic only)

### üí° Recent Decisions & Ideas
- **AGENT.md Pattern:** Created standardized instructions for AI tools to maintain project state
- **Information Architecture:** Separated concerns - README (vision), MVP (scope), PROGRESS (current status), AGENT (instructions)
- **AI Participant Strategy:** 3 distinct personalities - Alice (analytical), Bob (creative), Charlie (contrarian)
- **Technology Choices:** LangGraph for orchestration, existing SSE foundation, custom adapter for AI SDK compatibility
- **ADR System:** Major technical decisions now documented in docs/adr/ with structured format
- **Documentation Consolidation:** Eliminated PATTERNS.md redundancy, moved content to ADRs and AGENT.md
- **Environment Setup:** Templated .env.example with comprehensive API key setup
- **AI-Native Workflow:** Self-maintaining documentation system for seamless AI collaboration
- **Git Structure:** Clean commits with proper separation of concerns

## üîß Quick Start Commands

**Terminal 1 - Backend (Python 3.13):**
```bash
cd /Users/dbu/workspace/conversaition/backend
source .venv/bin/activate
# Environment variables loaded from .env file automatically
python main.py
```

     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"topic": "Should AI have creative rights?", "participants": ["Alice", "Bob"]}'

# Stream conversation events
curl "http://localhost:8000/conversation/stream"
```
